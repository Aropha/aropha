At [Aropha](https://www.aropha.com/), we specialize in delivering digital twin solutions with high precision and scalability. Our digital twins specifically designed to simulate the biodegradation processes of macromolecular polymers. For an example of our inference pipeline, explore this [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ypmo0l414TZhx4JTFwuT1bduYs0iRqgw?usp=drive_link) notebook.

## Overview
This repository, **aropha**, provides an interface to read your in-silico biodegradation experiments from a spreadsheet template, send them to Aropha’s processing servers to run biodegradation simulations, and retrieve the results to your computer. Our service is designed with privacy at its core with zero visibility into your data. We ensure that your data is never stored on hard drives, databases, or any persistent storage — not even temporarily. All computations are performed entirely in RAM, and the results are securely delivered directly to you.

### Installation
Aropha's clients can locally install this inference pipeline using the following pip command:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/aropha/aropha.git
```

### Current AI engines
We currently offer the **ArophaBiodegEngine_v1.0**, a comprehensive digital twin solution that can simulate the biodegradation processes of macromolecular polymers as well as small molecules.

Our digital twin development team is constantly working to enhance our engines, and we will update this repository as we expand our solutions to address additional biodegradation challenges.
