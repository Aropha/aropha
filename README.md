At [Aropha](https://www.aropha.com/), we are dedicated to delivering digital twin solutions with exceptional precision and scalability. Our digital twins were specifically tailored to simulate biodegradation processes of macromolecular polymers. For a detailed example on this inference pipeline, please visit this [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ypmo0l414TZhx4JTFwuT1bduYs0iRqgw?usp=drive_link) notebook.

Our service is designed with privacy at its core, operating with zero visibility into your data. We ensure that your data is never stored on hard drives, databases, or any persistent storage. All computations are performed entirely in RAM, and results are securely delivered directly to you.

Currently, we only offer a comprehensive digital twin solution called **ArophaBiodegEngine_v1.0**. This engine is capable of processing macromolecular polymers with known building block monomers as well as any chemicals for which the SMILES strings are available. Our team is continuously working to expand the capabilities of our digital twins engines, and we will update our offerings as we broaden our coverage to address a wider range of biodegradation challenges.
